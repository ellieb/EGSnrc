# Dose Viewer

Dose viewer is a (WIP) web-based visualization tool for EGSnrc phantom and dose files.

## Usage

To run this webpage locally:

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Using the command line, `cd` into the dose-viewer folder
3.  If you have Python 3, start a local server using the command

         python -m http.server

    If you have Python 2, use the command
